## 📖 Overview

This application is a support tool for structuring ideas.  
Users can arrange items as cards to help visualize and organize what components are needed.  
Currently, it works locally and does not have features to connect to the network or fetch external information.  
The motivation for development was the desire to use such a tool on my own smartphone.
